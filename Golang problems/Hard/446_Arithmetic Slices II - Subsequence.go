/*

Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7], and [3, -1, -5, -9] are arithmetic sequences.
For example, [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not an arithmetic sequence.
A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 16
Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.


Constraints:

1  <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
